# Speed-monitoring
This repository uses YOLOv3 to detect cars and calculate the car speed by optical flow

# RUN
Simply run command below to detect cars and monitor car speeds. Change video path and mask manually before run the python file. 

        python speed_control_encapsulated.py 

The mask provided only works for two videos('video_01.mp4' and 'video_02.mp4') in the repository. Other videos with different scenarios need different masks. You may run mask.py file to create a new mask photo by providing a point array.

# PERFORMANCE
This python file uses a trained YOLOv3 weights from COCO dataset. Both YOLOv3 and YOLOv3-tiny are tested. 

Results below are GPU accelerated. 

GPU: RTX2070

RESULTS:
    
        YOLOv3: FPS=20
    
        YOLOv3 + optical flow: FPS=10

        tiny YOLOv3: FPS=30
    
        tiny YOLOv3 + optical flow: FPS=15

# Limitations and future improvements
1. Cuda version optical flow algorithms (need c++). 
2. Sparse optical flow algorithm. We tried cv2.calcOpticalFlowPyrLK. Since the algorithm requires some feature points, but the number of cars in the video increase or reduce with the change of time, so can not persude myself...
